# Getting-to-Philosophy
simple implementation of getting to philosophy problem using python

The user is required to enter the wikipedia link as an input to the program.

The program will then find the first link that is not a redlink, italic and between parantheses and will request that page.
It will keep doing so until it reaches the philosophy page, finds a loop or does not find a link.
